# Most-dominant-colour-recognition
The project is an advanced color analysis tool that identifies and returns the five most dominant colors from any given image. Utilizing sophisticated image processing algorithms, the platform extracts color data, analyzes the frequency and prominence of colors within the image, and provides users with a palette of the top five colors. This tool is invaluable for designers, artists, and marketers who need to quickly understand and utilize color schemes from various visual inputs.

The project leverages the OpenCV library for robust image processing and the imutils package for streamlined image manipulation, providing a powerful combination for color analysis and extraction.
